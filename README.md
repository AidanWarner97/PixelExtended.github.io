Contains a copy of my resume, as well as some links to Github.

Built using HTML5 and Bootstrap.

[View it at the following address: https://jasond94.github.io](https://jasond94.github.io)

This technically redirects to the domain [downing.io](http://downing.io/). But either one works!

Based on the [Creative Bootstrap theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/)
from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
The theme is also MIT Licensed.

Built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) (for the domain), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the hosting and some other randomness I probably forgot. Check out the source code for more info.

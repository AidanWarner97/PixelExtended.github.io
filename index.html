    Note: much of this design comes from a previce personal website that I built over the summer.
    I've redesigned this one, using much of the same <head> but redoing nearly all of the body.
    Some of the CSS is similar or reused, but much of it was changed.
    I also added multiple pages and the menu bar at the top.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en-US">
<head>

<!-- Bootstrap settings -->
<meta charset = "utf-8">
<meta http-equiv = "X-UA-Compatible" content = "IE-edge">
<meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1, maximum-scale = 1, user-scalable = no">

<!-- This is the Nav Bar, for switching between pages. It should automatically become smaller on Mobile.
(Test this though!)

Note: I originally wrote part of this for another webpage, and I reworked it for this webpage.

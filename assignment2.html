    Created: September 3rd, 2015.
    Last Updated: September 4th, 2015 at 10PM.

    Note: much of this design comes from a previous personal website that I built over the summer.
    I've redesigned this one, using much of the same <head> but redoing nearly all of the body.
    Some of the CSS is similar or reused, but much of it was changed.
    I also added multiple pages and the menu bar at the top.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en-US">
<head>

<!-- Bootstrap settings -->
<meta charset = "utf-8">
<meta http-equiv = "X-UA-Compatible" content = "IE-edge">
<meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1, maximum-scale = 1, user-scalable = no">

<!-- This is the Nav Bar, for switching between pages. It should automatically become smaller on Mobile.
(Test this though!)

Note: I originally wrote part of this for another webpage, and I reworked it for this webpage.

Note: the id "About" is just for linking on the page using the Nav Bar.
I found out how to do this correctly at this Stackoverflow page:

<div class = "row">

<!-- I found this on Stackoverflow. I'm using this trick to make the "About" link actually go all the way to the top of the
page. It offsets by 50px which is enough.
See this page:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10732690/offsetting-an-html-anchor-to-adjust-for-fixed-header

    <!-- These columns have been optimized for mobile, tablet and desktop views.

    one note: the XS columns are set to 12 in order to prevent the contact image from overlapping the text. This bug made it hard to read the
    text on mobile and looked bad.

    Also, the center tag is there to improve mobile display as well. (centered image looks better IMO)   -->

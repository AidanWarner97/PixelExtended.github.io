Since I'm using a custom domain on GitHub, my GitHub pages repositories do not
follow the usual GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE.github.io format. If the domain
fails for some reason, you can still access my site by going to
[https://jasond94.github.io](https://jasond94.github.io)

Based on the
[Creative Bootstrap theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/)
from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
The theme is also MIT Licensed.

Built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS,
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for JS,
[namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for the awesome domain,
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting, and
[git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control
